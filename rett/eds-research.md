## 1. EDS OVERVIEW & TYPES

### What is Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome?

Ehlers-Danlos Syndromes (EDS) are a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of heritable connective tissue disorders (HCTDs) characterized by three hallmark features:
- **Joint hypermobility** (overly flexible joints)
- **Skin hyperextensibility** (stretchy skin)
- **Tissue fragility** (easy bruising, poor wound healing)

### The 2017 International Classification — All 13 Types

The International EDS Consortium (2017) recognizes **13 subtypes** caused by pathogenic variants in **19 different genes**. For all subtypes except hEDS, definitive diagnosis requires molecular/genetic confirmation.

| # | Type | Abbreviation | Gene(s) | Inheritance | Key Features |
|---|------|-------------|---------|-------------|--------------|
| 1 | **Classical EDS** | cEDS | COL5A1, COL5A2 (rarely COL1A1) | AD | Skin hyperextensibility, atrophic scarring, generalized joint hypermobility |
| 2 | **Classical-like EDS** | clEDS | TNXB | AR | Skin fragility, joint hypermobility, NO atrophic scarring |
| 3 | **Hypermobile EDS** | hEDS | **Unknown** (KLK15 candidate, see Section 6) | AD | Most common type. Soft/smooth/fragile skin, hypermobile joints, frequent dislocations, scoliosis, chronic pain |
| 4 | **Vascular EDS** | vEDS | COL3A1 (rarely COL1A1) | AD | Thin/translucent skin, fragile arteries/organs, life-threatening arterial & organ rupture. Median lifespan ~51 years |
| 5 | **Kyphoscoliotic EDS** | kEDS | PLOD1, FKBP14 | AR | Severe kyphoscoliosis (sideways + hunched spine), muscle hypotonia at birth, fragile sclera |
| 6 | **Arthrochalasia EDS** | aEDS | COL1A1, COL1A2 | AD | Congenital bilateral hip dislocation, severe joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility |
| 7 | **Dermatosparaxis EDS** | dEDS | ADAMTS2 | AR | Extremely fragile skin (doughy texture), severe bruising, hernias |
| 8 | **Cardiac-valvular EDS** | cvEDS | COL1A2 | AR | Heart valve problems (aortic/mitral), stretchy skin, joint hypermobility |
| 9 | **Periodontal EDS** | pEDS | C1R, C1S | AD | Early-onset severe periodontitis (puberty), tooth loss, pretibial plaques |
| 10 | **Spondylodysplastic EDS** | spEDS | B4GALT7, B3GALT6, SLC39A13 | AR | Short stature, decreased muscle tone, limb bowing |
| 11 | **Musculocontractural EDS** | mcEDS | CHST14, DSE | AR | Congenital multiple contractures, characteristic craniofacial features, skin hyperextensibility |
| 12 | **Myopathic EDS** | mEDS | COL12A1 | AD/AR | Muscle weakness in early childhood, large joint contractures (knee, hip, elbow) |
| 13 | **Brittle Cornea Syndrome** | BCS | ZNF469, PRDM5 | AR | Thin cornea prone to rupture, keratoconus, blue sclerae |

**Genetic Groups**:
- **Group A**: Disorders affecting primary collagen structure and processing
- **Group B**: Disorders affecting collagen folding and crosslinking

**Autosomal Dominant genes**: COL1A1, COL1A2, COL3A1, COL5A1, COL5A2, COL12A1, C1R, C1S
**Autosomal Recessive genes**: B4GALT7, B3GALT6, SLC39A13, ADAMTS2, TNXB, PLOD1, FKBP14, ZNF469, PRDM5, CHST14, DSE, AEBP1

### Prevalence

| Type | Estimated Prevalence |
|------|---------------------|
| All EDS types combined | ~1 in 5,000 (likely underestimate) |
| Hypermobile EDS (hEDS) | 1 in 500 to 1 in 5,000 |
| Classical EDS (cEDS) | 1 in 20,000 to 1 in 40,000 |
| Vascular EDS (vEDS) | 1 in 100,000 to 1 in 200,000 |
| Rare subtypes | < 1 in 1,000,000 |

**Israel-specific**: Approximately **500 diagnosed EDS patients** in Israel; about **87% are women** (Sheba Medical Center data). The true number is likely much higher due to underdiagnosis.

**Important note**: Experts believe ALL prevalence figures are underestimates because many people with EDS/HSD do not get diagnosed, take many years to get diagnosed, or are misdiagnosed with another condition.

### Beighton Score — Hypermobility Assessment

The **Beighton Score** is a 9-point scoring system used to measure Generalized Joint Hypermobility (GJH). Originally developed as an epidemiological screening tool, later adopted for clinical diagnosis.

**5 Maneuvers (4 bilateral, 1 unilateral)**:
1. Passive dorsiflexion of 5th MCP joint beyond 90 degrees (left + right = 2 points)
2. Passive apposition of thumb to flexor aspect of forearm (left + right = 2 points)
3. Hyperextension of elbow beyond 10 degrees (left + right = 2 points)
4. Hyperextension of knee beyond 10 degrees (left + right = 2 points)
5. Forward flexion of trunk with palms flat on floor (knees straight) (1 point)

**Positive Score Thresholds**:
- Adults: ≥ 5/9
- Children (pre-puberty): ≥ 6/9
- Adults over 50: ≥ 4/9

**Limitations**: Predominantly assesses upper limb joints; does not capture hypermobility in shoulders, hips, ankles, or spine. Cannot directly identify GJH on its own.

## 2. DIAGNOSIS CHALLENGES

### The Diagnostic Odyssey

EDS is one of the most misdiagnosed and underdiagnosed conditions in medicine. Key statistics:

- **94.4% of EDS patients** had been misdiagnosed with psychiatric illnesses at some point
- **88%** were told they were "making it up"
- **76%** were told they were attention-seeking
- **67%** were diagnosed with conversion disorder
- **60%** were told "it was in their head"
- **4%** were diagnosed with Munchausen syndrome / factitious disorder
- **Average alternative diagnoses before EDS**: **10.45** different diagnoses

**Source**: "The Incidence of Misdiagnosis in Patients with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome," *Children*, 2025 (study of 429 patients). [PMC12191865](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12191865/)

### Common Misdiagnoses

Due to limited awareness among healthcare providers, EDS patients are frequently misdiagnosed with:
- Fibromyalgia
- Chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS)
- Rheumatoid arthritis
- Conversion disorder / functional neurological disorder
- Anxiety/depression (somatic symptom disorder)
- "Growing pains" in children

**Source**: [Diagnosing EDS: Challenges & Progress - Rheumatology Advisor](https://www.rheumatologyadvisor.com/features/diagnosing-ehlers-danlos-syndrome/)

### Average Time to Diagnosis

- Estimated **10-12 years** average diagnostic delay for hEDS
- Patients see an average of **8+ specialists** before receiving a correct diagnosis
- The biomarker research by Ritelli et al. (2025) notes the average is "around 12 years"

### The "Zebra" Metaphor

Medical students are taught: **"When you hear hoofbeats behind you, don't expect to see a zebra"** — an aphorism coined in the late 1940s by **Theodore Woodward**, professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. This teaching encourages looking for common diagnoses first.

The EDS community adopted the **zebra** as its mascot because:
- EDS patients ARE the unexpected "zebras" — rare conditions hiding among common symptoms
- No two zebras have identical stripes, just as no two EDS patients have identical symptoms
- The zebra ribbon is now used worldwide for EDS and rare disease awareness

**Sources**:

- [Understanding the Zebra Label in EDS - The EDS Clinic](https://www.eds.clinic/articles/why-the-zebra-label-ehlers-danlos-syndrome-eds)

### hEDS Diagnostic Challenge

hEDS is the **only subtype** without an identified genetic marker. The 2017 criteria require meeting **three criteria simultaneously**:
1. Generalized Joint Hypermobility (Beighton Score)
2. Two or more features from: systemic manifestations, positive family history, musculoskeletal complications
3. Exclusion of alternative diagnoses

Genetic testing remains underutilized due to lack of insurance coverage and limited access in some regions.

## 3. CURRENT TREATMENTS

### Overview — No Cure

There is **no cure** for EDS. Treatment is focused on **symptom management**, **injury prevention**, and **quality of life improvement**. Treatment must be individualized.

### Physical Therapy — The Muldowney Protocol

**Kevin Muldowney, MsPT** has been treating EDS patients since 2005 and developed a specialized exercise protocol.

**Book**: *"Living Life to the Fullest with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome"* (2015)
- Designed as a guide for roughly **1 year of stabilizing exercises** plus a daily maintenance program
- Specific muscles targeted in a **precise sequence** to safely strengthen each joint
- Every exercise hand-picked to strengthen specific muscles while ensuring safety of other body areas
- Combines manual therapy (muscle energy, craniosacral therapy, myofascial release) with progressive exercises

**Key principles**:
- Strengthen muscles to compensate for ligament laxity
- Develop proper sequence for safe strengthening
- Focus on proprioception and stability
- Avoid overstretching (already hypermobile joints)

- [Muldowney Protocol - Progressive PT](https://progressiveptandrehab.com/the-muldowney-protocol-for-hypermobility-and-ehlers-danlos-syndrome-eds/)

### Pain Management

**What works for EDS pain**:
- **Low-Dose Naltrexone (LDN)**: 0.5 mg start, titrate to 3.0-4.5 mg nightly (optimal range 0.1-6.0 mg/day). Must be compounded. Works by calming overactive nerves and reducing neuroinflammation. Rush University reported success weaning patients off narcotics to LDN 4.5mg daily.
- **Physical/Occupational Therapy**: Vital for strengthening and joint stabilization
- **TENS (Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation)**
- **Trigger point injections**
- **Laser therapy**
- **Bracing and splinting**: Custom braces for joint support
- **Topical medications**: Lidocaine patches, diclofenac gel

**What often doesn't work / should be approached cautiously**:
- **Opioids**: Risk of dependence, often poorly effective for connective tissue pain
- **NSAIDs long-term**: GI risks, especially with concurrent MCAS
- **Surgery**: Often less effective due to poor wound healing and tissue fragility

## 4. COMORBIDITIES — DEEP DIVE

### 4A. MCAS (Mast Cell Activation Syndrome)

**Relationship with EDS**: MCAS frequently co-occurs with hypermobile EDS (hEDS). Both conditions involve dysregulation of connective tissues and immune system responses. The triad of **hEDS + MCAS + POTS** is increasingly recognized as interconnected.

**Symptoms**: Flushing, hives, GI issues (nausea, diarrhea, cramping), anaphylaxis-like episodes, brain fog, fatigue, headaches, itching, swelling

**Treatment (must be individualized)**:

| Medication | Type | Use |
|-----------|------|-----|
| **Cromolyn Sodium** | Mast cell stabilizer | GI symptoms. Prevents mast cells from releasing histamine. Oral (Gastrocrom) or nebulized |
| **Ketotifen** | Mast cell stabilizer + H1 antihistamine | Dual action. Popular for multi-system MCAS symptoms |
| **H1 Blockers** (cetirizine, loratadine, fexofenadine) | Antihistamines | Skin/respiratory symptoms |
| **H2 Blockers** (famotidine, ranitidine) | Antihistamines | GI symptoms, acid reflux |
| **Quercetin** | Natural mast cell stabilizer | Supplement, mild effect |
| **Vitamin C** | DAO enzyme support | Helps break down histamine |

**Key note**: Drug treatment needs to be tailored to individual patients — tolerance and benefit vary widely. Many patients require combination therapy.

### 4B. Craniocervical Instability (CCI)

**Definition**: Instability at the junction between the skull (cranium) and upper cervical spine, increasingly recognized in hereditary connective tissue disorders.

**Symptoms**: Severe headache and neck pain, cervical medullary syndrome, lower cranial nerve deficits, myelopathy, brainstem compression

**Diagnosis**:
- **Upright/Dynamic MRI** is critical (supine MRI may miss instability)
- Radiological metrics: clivo-axial angle, Grabb-Oakes measurement, Harris measurement
- Dr. Bolognese reads dynamic MRIs remotely, even from Europe

**Connection to EDS**: Especially common in EDS patients due to ligament laxity. In a study of 53 CCI patients with EDS, Chiari Malformation 1 or CSF flow obstruction was frequently co-diagnosed.

**Surgical Options**:
- **Occipito-cervical fusion (OCF)**: Screws and rods stabilize skull-to-spine junction
- **Dr. Fraser C. Henderson**: Pioneer in CCI surgery for EDS patients
- **Dr. Paolo Bolognese**: Developed **MIST** (Minimally Invasive Subpial Tonsillectomy) — a less invasive Chiari decompression plus fusion using occipital condyle screws

**Outcomes**: A study published in *Neurosurgical Review* (2023) analyzed outcomes of occipito-cervical fusion in EDS patients with CCI. [PMC10758368](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10758368/)

### 4C. CSF Leaks (Spontaneous Intracranial Hypotension)

**Definition**: Spontaneous leakage of cerebrospinal fluid, typically from the spine, causing low-pressure headaches and neurological symptoms.

**Connection to EDS/CTD**: The connective tissue weakness in EDS predisposes to meningeal diverticula and dural tears. 2024-2025 research explores associations between CTD and SIH, with meningeal diverticula playing a key role.

**Key Diagnostic Challenges**:
- At least **19% of SIH patients** have normal-appearing brain MRI
- Brain MRI changes in chronic SIH may **disappear over time** despite persistent leak
- Low opening pressure is diagnostically **unreliable** — most SIH patients have normal-range opening pressure

**Treatment**:
- **Epidural Blood Patch (EBP)**: First-line treatment
  - Non-targeted EBP: Short-term improvement 88%, long-term improvement only 33%
  - **Targeted EBP**: 87.1% improvement after first administration (vs. 52% for blind EBP)
  - Guidelines recommend up to 2 non-targeted patches before considering targeted approach
- **Surgical repair**: For refractory cases
- **Fibrin glue patches**: Alternative to blood patches

### 4D. Chiari Malformation

**Type 1 Chiari Malformation**: Cerebellar tonsils herniate through the foramen magnum, obstructing CSF flow. Frequently co-occurs with CCI in EDS patients.

**Connection to EDS**: In the study of 53 EDS+CCI patients, CSF flow obstruction was assessed in 32 patients — Chiari 1 or low-lying cerebellar tonsils/foramen magnum stenosis was frequently diagnosed.

**Treatment**:
- **Foramen magnum decompression**: Limited decompression used when CSF flow obstruction confirmed
- **MIST** (Dr. Bolognese): Minimally invasive subpial tonsillectomy
- **Critical consideration**: Some EDS patients who undergo Chiari decompression later develop CCI (destabilization), requiring subsequent fusion surgery

**Source**: Henderson et al., "Craniocervical Stabilization After Failed Chiari Decompression: A Case Series of a Population with High Prevalence of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome," 2022. [PubMed: 35192974](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35192974/)

### 4E. Dysautonomia / POTS

**POTS (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome)**: A form of dysautonomia characterized by an excessively fast heart rate (≥30 bpm increase or >120 bpm within 10 minutes of standing) and symptoms of lightheadedness upon standing.

**Prevalence**:
- Estimated **1-3 million Americans** affected by POTS
- May affect up to **1% of population**
- **~80% of hEDS patients** experience POTS symptoms
- **~31% of POTS patients** are diagnosed with hEDS

**Diagnosis**: **Tilt table test** — patient strapped to table that tilts from horizontal to 60-70 degrees upright, monitoring heart rate and blood pressure response.

**Treatment**:

| Medication | Dose | Mechanism | Notes |
|-----------|------|-----------|-------|
| **Fludrocortisone (Florinef)** | 0.1-0.2 mg daily | Increases salt/fluid retention, expands blood volume | May deplete potassium/magnesium. Depression risk <5% |
| **Midodrine (ProAmatine)** | 2.5-10 mg TID | Alpha-1 agonist, vasoconstriction | Effective for hypovolemic POTS subtype |
| **IV Saline** | As needed | Direct volume expansion | Used for acute flares, some patients need regular infusions |
| **Compression garments** | — | Prevent venous pooling | Waist-high recommended over knee-high |
| **Salt supplementation** | 3-10g/day | Volume expansion | Combined with increased fluid intake (2-3L/day) |
| **Beta blockers** (propranolol, ivabradine) | Low dose | Control tachycardia | Start very low in EDS patients |

**Non-pharmacological**: Increased salt intake, increased fluids (2-3L/day), compression stockings (waist-high), counter-maneuvers (leg crossing, muscle tensing), reconditioning exercise programs

### 4F. Vascular Compression Syndromes

Vascular compression syndromes are **frequently underdiagnosed** in EDS patients due to rarity, clinician unfamiliarity, and non-specific symptoms.

| Syndrome | What's Compressed | By What | Key Symptoms |
|----------|------------------|---------|-------------|
| **May-Thurner (MTS)** | Left iliac vein | Right iliac artery | Left leg pain, swelling, DVT risk |
| **Nutcracker (NCS)** | Left renal vein | Aorta + superior mesenteric artery | Flank pain, hematuria |
| **MALS (Median Arcuate Ligament)** | Celiac artery | Median arcuate ligament | Abdominal pain after eating, weight loss |
| **Thoracic Outlet (TOS)** | Brachial plexus/subclavian vessels | Clavicle/scalene muscles | Arm pain, tingling, numbness, weakness |
| **Pelvic Congestion** | Pelvic veins | Related to other VCS | Chronic pelvic pain |

**EDS Connection**: EDS, particularly hEDS and vEDS, is frequently associated with VCS due to connective tissue abnormalities. A 2024 case report documented a patient with EDS presenting with **multiple simultaneous VCS** (NCS + MTS + SMAS + MALS). [PMC11297806](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11297806/)

**Diagnosis**: Requires integration of clinical presentation and **dynamic imaging**:
- Color Doppler ultrasound
- CT angiography
- MR angiography
- Catheter-directed digital subtraction angiography
- Dynamic (positional) imaging is crucial — many findings are position-dependent

**Treatment consideration**: Complete evaluation of ALL vascular compressions is recommended to reduce number of interventions and improve outcomes.

## 6. LATEST RESEARCH (2024-2026)

### BREAKTHROUGH: KLK15 / Kallikrein Gene Discovery (Norris Lab, MUSC)

**The finding**: The **Norris Lab at MUSC (Medical University of South Carolina)** identified variants in the **Kallikrein gene family**, particularly **KLK15** (Kallikrein-15), as implicated in the pathogenesis of hEDS.

**Details**:
- Missense variant **KLK15 p.Gly226Asp** segregated with disease in two families
- Genetic burden analysis of **197 sporadic hEDS patients** showed enrichment of variants within the Kallikrein gene family
- Expanded to **200 patients** — rare/low-frequency variants found in **14 of 15 KLK genes**
- Recurrent KLK15 missense variant (p.Gly226Asp) segregating in multiple families

**Mouse model validation**: **Klk15^G224D/+** knock-in mice displayed:
- Structural and functional connective tissue defects in multiple organ systems
- Changes in mitral and aortic valves (healthy mice had none)
- hEDS-like symptoms confirming causative role

**Publication**: Gensemer et al., "Variants in the Kallikrein Gene Family and Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome," *iScience*, 2024. [PMC11213194](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11213194/)

**Follow-up**: "KLK15 alters connective tissues in hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome," *iScience*, 2025. [PubMed: 40949095](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40949095/)

**IMPORTANT CAVEATS**:
- KLK15 **cannot currently be tested** by commercial genetic testing companies
- KLK15 is likely **not the only gene** involved in hEDS
- There is **still no genetic test** that can identify hEDS
- The Norris Lab update (June 2024) emphasized this is one piece of a larger puzzle

**Source**: [Norris Lab hEDS Genetic Study Update - Ehlers-Danlos Society (June 2024)](https://www.ehlers-danlos.com/norris-lab-update-june-2024/)

### GWAS Meta-Analysis (September 2025)

**Landmark study**: First genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis for hEDS.

**Study details** (Petrucci-Nelson et al., 2025):
- **1,815 cases** and **5,008 ancestry-matched controls** across 3 case-control studies
- Fixed-effects meta-analysis of **6.2 million variants**

**Key findings**:
- **Two loci** reached genome-wide significance
- A regulatory region near **ACKR3** (atypical chemokine receptor 3) on chromosome 2
  - Risk alleles colocalize with eQTLs in tibial nerve
  - Alter enhancer activity
  - Generate a de novo AHR transcription factor regulatory site
  - **Implicates neuroimmune and pain signaling pathways**
- Gene-based analysis identified **SLC39A13** (zinc transporter previously implicated in rare EDS form) and **PSMC3** (CNS development)
- **Genetic correlations** found with: joint hypermobility, ME/CFS, fibromyalgia, depression, anxiety, autism spectrum disorder, migraine, GI diseases

**Conclusion**: "First evidence of common variant contributions to hEDS, supporting a **complex, multisystem model involving neuroimmune-stromal dysregulation**."

### Biomarker Discovery: Fibronectin Blood Test (Ritelli et al., 2025)

**Study**: Examined blood samples from **466 adults**.

**Finding**: A specific **52 kDa fragment of fibronectin** found in blood of **every individual with hEDS and HSD**, but **absent** in:
- Healthy controls
- Individuals with other EDS types
- Those with various forms of arthritis

**Potential impact**: Could become the **first blood test** for hEDS/HSD diagnosis, potentially reducing the average 12-year diagnostic delay.

**CRITICAL CAVEAT**: A **replication study found NO evidence** of disease-specific enrichment of fibronectin and collagen-derived peptides. Independent validation is still needed before clinical use.

### Proteomic Discoveries (2025)

Proteomic analysis revealed **35 differentially expressed proteins** in hEDS:
- **43%** involved in the complement cascade
- **80%** linked to immune, coagulation, or inflammatory pathways

| Tai Chi | Elliptical trainer | Heavy weightlifting |
| Rowing (modified) | Dance (low impact) | Plyometrics / jumping |
| Isometric exercises | — | Competitive stretching |

**Key principle**: Strengthen muscles to support joints WITHOUT pushing joints past their (already excessive) range of motion.

### Nutrition

- **Exclusion diets** can help identify trigger foods (especially with co-occurring MCAS)
- Dietary supplements may be beneficial (Vitamin C, magnesium, electrolytes)
- Increased salt intake for POTS management (3-10g/day)
- Increased fluid intake (2-3L/day)
- Small, frequent meals (for gastroparesis/GI issues)
- Anti-inflammatory diet principles may help

### Joint Protection

- Custom braces and splints for vulnerable joints
- **Ring splints (Silver Ring Splints)** for finger hypermobility
- Compression garments

## 8. ISRAELI REALITY

### EDS Clinics in Israel

#### Sheba Medical Center — Center for Diagnosis and Treatment of EDS (NEW, ~2024-2025)

**Led by**: Dr. Yael Gazit, pediatrician and EDS specialist
**Location**: Sheba Medical Center (Tel HaShomer), Ramat Gan
**Website**: [shebaonline.org](https://www.shebaonline.org/center-for-eds-opens-at-sheba/)

**Services**: Diagnosis, treatment, rehabilitation, and research for Ehlers-Danlos syndromes. Multidisciplinary approach.

**Context**: This is a **significant development** — Sheba reports approximately **500 diagnosed EDS patients** in Israel (87% women), and the center is witnessing increasing patient numbers who had been undiagnosed or untreated for years.

**Note**: Dr. Yael Gazit has published research on EDS-Hypermobility Type in *Rambam Maimonides Medical Journal* and also has affiliations with Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center. [ResearchGate Profile](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yael-Gazit)

### Israeli Patient Organization

#### Agam Association (עמותת אגם) — EDS & Hypermobility Community Israel

- **Full name**: עמותת אד"ס: אהלרס-דנלוס ישראל (תסמונת גמישות יתר) (ע"ר)
- **Registration**: Registered non-profit (GuideStar #580624922)
- **Website**: [eds-israel.org.il](https://www.eds-israel.org.il/)
- **GuideStar page**: [guidestar.org.il/organization/580624922](https://www.guidestar.org.il/organization/580624922)

**Activities**:
- Promoting awareness in public and healthcare institutions
- Early detection and appropriate treatment advocacy
- Lectures at PT institutes, OT, rehabilitation, child development centers, family clinics, mental health clinics, conferences
- Information on EDS subtypes, diagnostics, and body movement education
- Policy change advocacy for maximizing patient rights

### Relevant Hospital Departments

While a dedicated EDS clinic at Sheba is the primary resource, relevant departments at major Israeli hospitals include:
- **Genetics departments**: Hadassah, Sheba, Rambam, Schneider Children's
- **Rheumatology**: All major hospitals
- **Pain clinics**: Various hospitals (but most lack EDS-specific expertise)
- **Cardiology** (for POTS/dysautonomia)
- **GI departments** (for motility issues)

### Health Basket (סל הבריאות) Coverage

**Status**: Not specifically verified in research. Key considerations:
- Genetic testing for EDS types (except hEDS) should be covered when indicated
- PT/OT should be accessible through kupat cholim referral
- Pain management medications (standard) are typically covered
- **Specialty medications** like LDN require individual approval
- MCAS-specific treatments (cromolyn, ketotifen) may require off-label approvals
- **Compression garments** may be partially covered with prescription

**Note**: Coverage specifics were not found in web searches. Direct inquiry to kupat cholim and Sheba Medical Center recommended for current details.

### Kupat Cholim Programs for Rare Diseases

All four kupot cholim (Clalit, Maccabi, Meuhedet, Leumit) have **rare disease frameworks**, but EDS-specific programs are not well-documented online. The Agam Association would be the best resource for navigating kupat cholim coverage.

## 10. EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS

### Vascular EDS (vEDS) Emergencies

vEDS is the most **life-threatening** form of EDS. Emergencies include:
- **Spontaneous arterial rupture** (any artery, but especially aorta, mesenteric, iliac)
- **Organ rupture** (uterus, intestines, spleen, liver, lungs)
- **Spontaneous pneumothorax**
- Arterial dissection

**Key point**: The gastro-intestinal tract, gravid uterus, lungs, spleen, and liver are all prone to spontaneous rupture in vEDS.

### Anesthesia Considerations for ALL EDS Types

**Risks**:
- Difficulty with vascular access (tissue fragility)
- Risk of spontaneous arterial rupture perioperatively
- Possible cervical spine instability
- Airway trauma on intubation
- Local anesthetic resistance (reported in many hEDS patients)
- Prolonged bleeding
- TMJ issues complicating intubation

**vEDS-specific**: Neuraxial blockades (epidural/spinal) are recommended to be **AVOIDED** in vEDS patients — the potential risks outweigh benefits compared to planned general anesthesia.

**For all EDS patients, anesthesiologists should know**:
- Potential for cervical instability (careful intubation)
- Increased bruising/bleeding risk
- Possible local anesthetic resistance
- Avoid excessive joint manipulation during positioning
- Fragile skin (careful with tape, adhesives)
- MCAS considerations (avoid histamine-releasing agents)

**Source**: Wiesmann et al., "Recommendations for anesthesia and perioperative management in patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome(s)," *Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases*, 2014. [Springer](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13023-014-0109-5)

### Wound Healing Issues

Three basic surgical problems in EDS:
1. **Tissues are weakened** — less suitable for surgery
2. **Blood vessel fragility** — bleeding complications during surgery
3. **Wound healing is often delayed or incomplete** — atrophic scars, wound dehiscence

**Source**: [Anesthesia Risks for EDS - The EDS Clinic](https://www.eds.clinic/articles/anesthesia-risks-for-ehlers-danlos-syndrome-patients)

### Pregnancy Risks

**ALL EDS types**: Premature labor, uterine prolapse, postpartum hemorrhage, pelvic instability, delayed wound healing, DVT, coccyx dislocation

**Vascular EDS pregnancy — HIGH RISK**:
- Elevated risk of **uterine rupture**, vascular events, digestive events, and **death**
- **Risk of death** during or immediately after pregnancy: estimated **1 in 233**
- Increased hemodynamic volatility and vascular stress
- Severe postpartum hemorrhage risk

**Spinal anesthesia for cesarean in vEDS**: Case reported in [PMC5829370](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5829370/)

## APPENDIX: KEY UNVERIFIED OR PARTIALLY VERIFIED FACTS

The following items appeared in research but could not be fully cross-referenced:

1. **500 diagnosed EDS patients in Israel** — This comes from Sheba Medical Center's reporting. The true number of affected individuals is likely significantly higher.

2. **hEDS prevalence of 1 in 500** — Some sources cite this, others maintain 1 in 5,000. The true prevalence remains debated due to underdiagnosis.

3. **Fibronectin biomarker (Ritelli 2025)** — A replication study failed to confirm the finding. Independent validation is still required before clinical adoption.

4. **KLK15 as hEDS gene** — Validated in mouse models but acknowledged as likely ONE OF MANY genes involved. Not commercially testable.

5. **Kupat cholim coverage for EDS treatments** — Specific coverage details for LDN, cromolyn, ketotifen, compression garments, and specialty PT were not found in English or Hebrew web searches. Direct inquiry recommended.

6. **12-year average diagnostic delay** — Cited by some sources but exact study methodology varies. The 10.45 average alternative diagnoses is from the 2025 misdiagnosis study (PMC12191865).
